# global-hotkey-qt

This project is a Proof of Concept to show how to globally intercept keypress
events and react to it. The whole mechanism is described in the blog's post
[Global hotkey](http://www.expobrain.net/2012/05/03/global-hotkey/).

To run this Proof of Concept install Qt Creator from the
[Qt](https://www.qt.io/) website and build the project.

The code can be build with both Qt 4.x and 5.x.
